# BCSB Production Codebase

Welcome to the official repository for BCSB's production code. This codebase is maintained by the internal Data Team and serves as the central hub for version-controlled, production-level data processes and reports.

## Repository Overview

The goal of this repository is to ensure that all data-related code is reliable, maintainable, and documented. It contains the following key areas:

- **`/Reports`**: Source code for all production reports, organized by business line.
- **`/cdutils`**: A shared library of common utilities and functions used across multiple projects.
- **`/testing`**: Scripts for running automated tests and executing reports.
- **`/orchestr8`**: Web-based graphical interface for on-demand job execution & scheduling through admin panel.
- **`/Documentation`**: In-depth guides, architectural diagrams, and development standards.
