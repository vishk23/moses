## Documentation

### Business Logic
The report processes loan data through the following steps:
1. Fetches data from OSIBANK core tables (accounts, loans, loan details)
2. Joins tables on account number with validation
3. Calculates net balances and total exposure
4. Adds primary keys and household numbers
5. Attaches secondary loan officers
6. Categorizes loans by product type
7. Generates owner_id for customer identification (O prefix for organizations, P prefix for persons)
8. Filters to required columns and formats for output
9. Names output file with report period (previous month and year)

### Key Calculations
- **Net Balance:** Book Balance - Charged Off Balance (COBAL)
- **Total Exposure:** Net Balance + Net Available + Net Collateral Reserve
- **Tax Exempt Bonds:** Uses NOTEBAL for CM45 products instead of BOOKBALANCE
- **Owner ID:** Formatted as "O{org_number}" for organizations or "P{person_number}" for individuals

### Data Sources
- **OSIBANK.WH_ACCTCOMMON:** Core account information, balances, officers, branches
- **OSIBANK.WH_LOANS:** Loan-specific details, origination, terms
- **OSIBANK.WH_ACCTLOAN:** Credit limits, percentages sold, collateral reserves
- **OSIEXTN.HOUSEHLDACCT:** Customer household relationships
