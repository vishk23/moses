Finished this up in early January and the business line users finally have PowerBI installed on their machines. I've copied this over to the business line as the place of record to run this.

All set up in that location and I'm trying to think of a way they can see the new taxids and old taxids.

I set them up with contract date filter and slider synced. We can make future additions and modifications as they identify them. Distributed this to Stephanie.
