Picking this back up.

Real estate loans for ins tracking is the goal.

Resi, commercial, HE loans in a flood zone

I need Kelly to walk through filters and a few examples to get me to exactly where I need to get to on this.

Thank you. It also needs to only home equity loans that are in a flood zone. We will have a blanket policy for HE and will not need to track them unless they are in a flood zone.

I was supposed to meet with Kelly, but I think things got busy on her end.

I'll work on this next week to bring to natural conclusion.
- there are assumptions and filters that I need her to check on. Sometimes, I don't know where things are in our uncataloged database.
