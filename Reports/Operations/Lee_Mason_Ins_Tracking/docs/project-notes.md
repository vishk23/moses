Picking this back up.

Real estate loans for ins tracking is the goal.

Resi, commercial, HE loans in a flood zone

---

I need Kelly to walk through filters and a few examples to get me to exactly where I need to get to on this.

---


Thank you. It also needs to only home equity loans that are in a flood zone. We will have a blanket policy for HE and will not need to track them unless they are in a flood zone.

I was supposed to meet with Kelly, but I think things got busy on her end.

I'll work on this next week to bring to natural conclusion.
- there are assumptions and filters that I need her to check on. Sometimes, I don't know where things are in our uncataloged database.

Most of the data is from account
- some accounts will have collateral
- some collateral will have insurance attached.
    - I think this is the link, but not sure


Account:
- acctnbr
- ownersortname
- Borrower_name_2 ?
    - NonTax Signator
- primary address (cleaned from BKM)
- primary city
- primary state
- primary zip
- notebal 
    - or bookbal
- creditlimitamt
- total exposure?
Collateral:
- Cleaned PropType
- proptypdesc
- Collateral type:
    - Real Esate/Auto/Misc?
- Prop street
- prop city
- prop state
- prop zip
Insurance:
- insurable value
- replacement cost
- flood zone
- coverage type
    - Hazard, flood, BPP, Auto
- premium escrowed
    - Yes/No
- loan type
    - Resi/Commercial
    - major or some form of product mapping
- building type?
    - residential/commercial/condo/mobile home/land
    - isn't this collateral type
        - proptypdesc

Questions for Kelly

On account table, do we only want accounts where there is an active insurance policy?

Commercial (CML/MLN)
Resi (MTG)
- HE only in flood zone?
    - These are a subset of MTG


Chad Business
- 123
    

L&M track every property end goal

4 types of home equity

Doesn't need PMI

If there is no property, don't include loan

coverageamt is the same for insurable value + replacement cost

Need to get this revision done by EOD

```text
I finally had a chance to review this draft file. Yes, please remove collateral for UCCâ€™s and Assignments.  I made notes on the top of the file for you. The red font columns can be deleted.

 

We need to include an HELOC or Home Equity loans that are in a flood zone or escrowed.
```

Above is message from Kelly

I think HE loans are in there.

Sent v2 to Kelly yesterday

A couple tweaks to make
- Esrow didn't come through correctly, fix
    - done
- If HE minors, line should be one (for prop) if floodzone = 'X', else we null it out, for other MTG and CML fields
    - 
- participations bought excluded
    - ACCTUSERFIELDS
        - PARP - Purchased/Bought (boolean)
        - PAPU - Purchased %

FPTS is sold?
- Should check this
- separate topic, outside scope here
    - not as reliable as totalpctsold.
    - not as well maintained of a field. Some where totalpctsold and no flag


Logic for final piece:
# Filter out HE records where flood zone = 'X'
heloc_minors = ['MG52','MG55','MG48','MG71']

# if record in cleaned df['currmiaccttypcd'].isin(heloc_minors) and cleaned_df['Flood_Zone'] contains X , or TBD, or B, or C (case insensitive)
# then drop the record

# Afterward: Next operation is to set anything in floodzone that contains contains X , or TBD, or B, or C (case insensitive) to None

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming cleaned_df is your DataFrame with columns 'currmiaccttypcd' and 'Flood_Zone'

# Define the list of heloc_minors
heloc_minors = ['MG52', 'MG55', 'MG48', 'MG71']

# Regex pattern to match 'X', 'TBD', 'B', or 'C' case-insensitively as substrings
flood_zone_pattern = r'(?i)(X|TBD|B|C)'

# Step 1: Drop rows where 'currmiaccttypcd' is in heloc_minors 
# AND 'Flood_Zone' contains one of the specified strings
mask_to_drop = (
    cleaned_df['currmiaccttypcd'].isin(heloc_minors) & 
    cleaned_df['Flood_Zone'].str.contains(flood_zone_pattern, na=False)
)
cleaned_df = cleaned_df[~mask_to_drop]

# Step 2: Set 'Flood_Zone' to None where it contains one of the specified strings
cleaned_df.loc[cleaned_df['Flood_Zone'].str.contains(flood_zone_pattern, na=False), 'Flood_Zone'] = None
```
