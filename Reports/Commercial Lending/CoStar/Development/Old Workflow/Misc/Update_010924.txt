I had the CoStar platform updated to pull current balance for all products except for construction/LOCs. 

FYI: Wychmere and Amicus (loans that you pointed out to me on our last call because they werenâ€™t showing up) have FDIC Category Codes of REOW, which is RE Own Occ, and REFI, which is RE 1-4 Res or Other. CoStar had recommended that I only load in Non-Owner Occupied or Multi-Family.
