Fixed this up.

Repo could still use cleaning up

The missing items on XAA are due to the accounts being closed or not included on allowed minor list

This was found in exploration notebook.

We can take the _merge right only to get XAA only and then join back active account data to see products:
- IOLTA
- Community checking
- Some personal stuff.
