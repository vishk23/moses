## Slice: Add Cash Management Officer

## TODO
- [x] Query Userfield for Cash Management Officer
    - This is built into cdutils so it's a simple import
- [x] Cleanly join with existing report (appending this field to the right)


### 2025-06-29 (Chad Doorley)
- I did this earlier, but will go back and confirm. Will be better about documentation and logs.
    - Really need version control system, but I'll make do with this until we get going.

Hi Hasan & Steve,

 

This is built out and is ready to run monthly. The Cash Management Officer role is all blank at the moment, but will populate column S once we start to utilize/maintenance this field.

 

Let me know your thoughts on next steps with this report or if this meets the requirements for now. 

 

Thanks,

Chad
