Overview: CRE Report for the Board (Semi-Annual)
===
This project aims to create clean visualizations and analysis of the Commercial Real Estate portfolio for a semi-annual presentation to the board. The data comes directly from the COCC core database and is segmented into different categories based on FDIC Category Code. There is a reconcilation step to the numbers we report on the quarterly Fed Call Report to ensure accuracy. The end output is a PowerBI dashboard with several visualizations that are put on a slide deck.
