A couple things on this.
- don't forget that pers is the end goal, where we will be having persnbr as the centralized view here

active acct assigned to N raynham is easy
address within 5 mi radius, need some geocoding
    - or simple rule to just get town name
age is easy to filter out

I think safe deposit boxes would have a branch name right?

Businesses are included too.
