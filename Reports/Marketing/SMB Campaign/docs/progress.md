- [x] Get tenure of business (oldest account - current date)
    - Or creation date on org table

Hi Kati - This is great.  It certainly will help with directional context of existing depositors.  I suggest that we revisit as part of our kickoff so you can securely share that data and we have an SOW in place.  I would also like to stratify tenure of business relationships and size of deposits on hand in addition to NAICS to see how acquired prospects compare from the calling program.  I look forward to keeping this as part of our strategy work for you.  Thank you.  Rick
