Started building this out.

First built in a notebook and it follows a clear pipeline. This will need to be converted to a formal/robust pipeline with tests and structured format to work with other reports.

Better to get the data out to them to review and spot check before I optimize.

This took ~1.5 hours to build mental map of everything and create notebook, spot check data, do transforms/calculations.

Hi Jeff & Genesis,

Here’s part 1 of what we discussed. Please review and let me know your thoughts. This can be refreshed at any cadence and I can tweak as needed. If there are any non-profits that you know are customers and are missing from this list, let me know I’ll investigate. Organizations are coded with ‘NP’ for Non-Profit/Charitable code and there is always the possibility that we have a non-profit that didn’t get coded correctly, but here is what COCC snapshot looks like.

These are non-profits that have at least 1 active account (Loan or Deposit) with the Bank as of last business day. I ran it today, so technically it would be as of Aug 14, 2025.

Have a great weekend,
Chad
