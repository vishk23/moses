Started building this out.

First built in a notebook and it follows a clear pipeline. This will need to be converted to a formal/robust pipeline with tests and structured format to work with other reports.

Better to get the data out to them to review and spot check before I optimize.

This took ~1.5 hours to build mental map of everything and create notebook, spot check data, do transforms/calculations.
