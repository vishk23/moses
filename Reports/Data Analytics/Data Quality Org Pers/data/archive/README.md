# Data Archive

Processed input files are automatically moved here after being merged with the pipeline data.

This folder serves as a permanent record of:
- All Excel files that have been processed
- Original filenames are preserved exactly
- Files are automatically overwritten if the same name is processed again

Archive files can be safely deleted if storage space is needed, as they are copies of already-processed data.
