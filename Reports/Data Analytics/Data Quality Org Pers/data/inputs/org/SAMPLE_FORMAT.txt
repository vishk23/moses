# Sample Organization Input File

This is an example of the expected format for organization input files.

## Instructions:
1. Delete this file
2. Place your actual Excel file (.xlsx or .xls) in this folder
3. Run the pipeline: `python -m src.main`

## Required Format:
- ORGNBR column (must match your processed org data)
- All column headers in UPPERCASE
- Additional columns will be merged (NOTES, CONTACT_PERSON, etc.)

## Example Data Structure:
```
ORGNBR | ORGNAME     | NOTES              | CONTACT_PERSON
1001   | Acme Corp   | Important client   | John Smith
1002   | Beta Inc    | New prospect       | Jane Doe
```
