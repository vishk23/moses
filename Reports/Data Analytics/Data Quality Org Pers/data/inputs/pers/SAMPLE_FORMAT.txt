# Sample Person Input File

This is an example of the expected format for person input files.

## Instructions:
1. Delete this file
2. Place your actual Excel file (.xlsx or .xls) in this folder
3. Run the pipeline: `python -m src.main`

## Required Format:
- PERSNBR column (must match your processed person data)
- All column headers in UPPERCASE
- Additional columns will be merged (COMMENTS, PRIORITY, etc.)

## Example Data Structure:
```
PERSNBR | LASTNAME | FIRSTNAME | COMMENTS        | PRIORITY
2001    | Smith    | John      | VIP customer    | High
2002    | Johnson  | Mary      | Regular buyer   | Medium
```
