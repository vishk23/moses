Had to fix the paths that were hard coded in the script

This script is a bit brittle. Ripe for standardization and refactor, including the way most of my other reports work. 

Okay, I refactored this to standard layout. Will have an issue when on the server when trying to write this to the CLO_Share, but that's a bridge I can cross later on. I'll have status page full working by then and have something like this writing and portfolio key being generated.
