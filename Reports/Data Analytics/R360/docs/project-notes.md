# R360 Customer Relationship Keys - Project Notes

*Consolidated documentation and running notes for the R360 project*

---

## Current Development Status (2025-07-25)

### Recent Issues & Resolutions

**Unicode Encoding Error (Windows)**
- **Issue:** R360 fails when run through testing framework due to Unicode emoji characters in config.py
- **Error:** `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f527'`
- **Solution:** Set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` environment variable in subprocess execution
- **Status:** Fixed in testing framework

**Testing Framework Integration**
- **Issue:** R360 runs successfully with direct `python -m src.main` but fails through `run_reports.py --daily`
- **Root Cause:** Virtual environment and Unicode encoding issues in subprocess execution
- **Solution:** Updated `run_reports.py` to use virtual environment Python and UTF-8 encoding
- **Status:** Resolved

### Current Configuration
- **Environment:** Dev mode with database operations disabled for safety
- **Historical DB:** Disabled (can be re-enabled in config)
- **Key Generation:** All three key types (portfolio, address, ownership) active
- **Storage:** SQLite databases in project directory during dev

### Project Goals
The goal is to create a centralized key to better understand the Bank's customers. This involves the creation of relationship keys (portfolio_key, address_key, ownership_key) which group customers based on different relationship criteria:

- **Portfolio Key:** Groups by address OR ownership (superhousehold/comprehensive relationships)
- **Address Key:** Groups by address only (household analysis)
- **Ownership Key:** Groups by ownership only (business concentration analysis)

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Database:** SQLite (development), targeting COCC (production)
- **Algorithm:** Union-Find for efficient relationship grouping
- **Integration:** cdutils library for system-wide access

### File Paths
- **Production Home:** `\\00-da1\Home\Share\Data & Analytics Initiatives\Project Management\Data_Analytics\R360`
- **Development:** Local project structure with src/, docs/, notebooks/ directories

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Business Logic
1. **Data Extraction:** Pull account common, address, and ownership data from OSIBANK warehouse tables
2. **Data Cleaning:** Apply business rules and create hash keys for address and ownership matching
3. **Relationship Grouping:** Use Union-Find algorithm to group accounts by specified criteria
4. **Key Assignment:** Assign persistent keys using historical data for consistency
5. **Storage:** Store results in SQLite databases for downstream consumption
6. **Integration:** Make available via cdutils for use across all systems

### Key Business Rules
- **IOLTA Exclusions:** Exclude legal trust accounts from grouping
- **Address Exclusions:** Exclude problematic shared business addresses (e.g., "29 Broadway")
- **Ownership Filtering:** Handle null CIFs and IOLTA committee structures
- **Persistence:** Keys remain stable across daily runs using historical databases

### Data Sources
- `OSIBANK.WH_ACCTCOMMON` - Account data
- `PERSADDRUSE`, `ORGADDRUSE` - Address relationships
- `WH_ADDR` - Address details
- `WH_ALLROLES` - Ownership relationships

### Output Files
- `r360_portfolio_YYYYMMDD.csv` - Portfolio keys
- `r360_address_YYYYMMDD.csv` - Address keys  
- `r360_ownership_YYYYMMDD.csv` - Ownership keys
- SQLite databases: `current.db`, `address.db`, `ownership.db`

## Technical Notes & Decisions

### 2025-07-25 - Testing Framework Integration
- Added virtual environment detection and UTF-8 encoding to resolve execution issues
- Testing framework now properly executes R360 through subprocess with correct Python environment
- Comprehensive logging added for debugging subprocess execution problems

### 2025-05-08 - Historical Database Strategy
- Historical database disabled due to size concerns and limited utilization
- No failed runs in over 2 months of daily execution
- Historical data strategy needs refinement:
  - Current approach creates large files with limited business value
  - Future approach should focus on tracking portfolio_key account counts over time
  - Useful for detecting early payoffs or non-standard contract behaviors
  - Priority should be current customer understanding before historical analytics

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Union-Find Algorithm:** Chosen for efficient handling of large datasets with complex relationship graphs
- **SQLite Storage:** Lightweight, reliable, and easily accessible across systems
- **Modular Architecture:** Enables maintenance and testing of individual components
- **Environment Safety:** Development mode prevents accidental production database modifications
- **cdutils Integration:** Centralized utility library enables cross-project functionality

---

## Operational Notes

### Daily Execution
- **Schedule:** Daily automated execution
- **Runtime:** Typically completes in under 5 minutes
- **Reliability:** 2+ months without failure
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging to environment-specific log files

### Error Handling
- **Unicode Issues:** Resolved with PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
- **Virtual Environment:** Automatic detection and usage
- **Database Safety:** Dev mode prevents accidental production writes
- **Exception Logging:** Full error capture with truncated summaries

### Business Validation
- **Portfolio Key:** Successfully tested and validated by business stakeholders
- **Exception Handling:** Hard-coded exclusions for known problematic data
- **Key Persistence:** Stable keys across daily runs using historical data
- **Business Rule Compliance:** Handles complex banking relationship structures

## Questions & Future Considerations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Exception Management:** Need user-friendly interface for managing grouping exceptions (currently hard-coded)
2. **Test Coverage:** Expand unit tests and edge case detection for production reliability
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Add metrics and alerting for daily execution monitoring

### Strategic Considerations
1. **Historical Analytics:** Develop business case for historical relationship tracking
2. **API Development:** Consider real-time lookup capabilities for other systems
3. **COCC Integration:** Plan migration from SQLite to core banking system storage
4. **Business Intelligence:** Direct integration with reporting and dashboard platforms

### Technical Debt
1. **Hard-coded Exclusions:** Move to configuration-driven exception management
2. **Type Hinting:** Complete type hinting implementation across all modules
3. **Documentation:** Maintain technical documentation as system evolves
4. **Testing Strategy:** Develop comprehensive test suite for production confidence

### Historical Notes & Decisions

#### 2025-05-08 (Chad Doorley)
- Tweaking this a bit. The historical database takes up a lot of space and is not being utilized at all. I made some adjustments (eliminating static dependencies and configuring it to use cdutils)
- Historical db can be turned back on
- This is really working great though, this hasn't had a failed run in over 2 months and it runs daily.
- Thinking about the approach to using the historical:
  - there must be a more efficient and better way to store this. I can't write out to historical.db every day, otherwise this balloons in size and I also haven't had a single use for it yet
  - I'm thinking the use would be to look at a particular portfolio_key and track # of accounts. This is noisy though, as CDs could just pay off or loans close and they are still customers, but they just reached maturity.
    - Maybe tracking things like they pay off early or do things outside of the normal timing set on contract.
    - I think this is something to explore down the line. It makes sense to first understand our customers at this point in time, segment into different categories, build reports/dashboards/applications around this to help us know our customers. Other items can be tackled in later phases.

### Additional Technical Context
- **Original Brief Description:** The goal is to create a centralized key to better understand the Bank's customers. This involves the creation of the portfolio_key, which is a superhousehold. This groups on ownership similarities or shared address.
- **Core Objectives:** The development of a robust data pipeline to accurately group customers and generate a key for each acctnbr that is consistent over time
- **Database Strategy:** Store this in a database (COCC is the goal, it is stored in a lightweight relational database for now (sqlite))
